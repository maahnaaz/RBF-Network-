# RBF-Network-
Implementing a Radial-Basis-Function network with Python from scratch. A method to
adjust the positions Ck and widths sk of the centers, a method to adjust the weights wkm
and a program that demonstrates the functionality of the RBF network are implemented.The weights wkm between RBF-neurons and output neurons are initialized by random
values from the interval of âˆ’0.5 to +0.5 and the structure of the network can be changed.
The learning curve of the network is also depicted.
